# ES6 Classes

JavaScript classes is what developers class Syntactical Sugar. 
It makes JavaScript a little easier or "sweetens " over JavaScript's existing protype-based inheritance. 

Classes are in fact JavaScript functions, you can define them either with an expression or declaration. 

[Class Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/class) VS [Class Declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class)

The `constructor` method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created with a `class`. There can only be one! â€“ per class, else a syntax error. 


## Class Expressions
Much like function expressions you can define them with a variable to initialize it, use the contructor key word and boom.

```javascript

let dog = class { 
    constructor(breed, age){
        this.breed = breed; 
        this.age = age; 
    }
}

console.log(dog.name)
// expected output => dog

let dog = class doggo{ 
    constructor(breed, age){
        this.breed = breed; 
        this.age = age; 
    }
}

console.log(dog.name)
// expected output => doggo

```

## Class Declarations
Much like function declarations you can define them by using the class keyword, a name, and the constructor keyword to initialize your `class`. 

```javascript

class Dog {
    constructor(breed, age){
        this.breed = breed; 
        this.age = age; 
    }
}

```

## this

`this` is a special key word that refers to the instance of the the class in that point in time. It refers to current object you're talking about. 

## Doggo

* So let's create a Class for our dogs, that creates objects with a breed, a first name, and an age. 

* In our magical land of speaking dogs, we're going to write a method that will have our dog speak

* Unfortunetly for us, dog's mature and age much faster than humans do, their life spans are much shorter. We're also going to create a method that converts our dog's years into human years. 


```javascript

class dog {
    constructor(breed, fname, age){
        this.breed = breed; 
        this.fname = fname; 
        this.age = age; 
    }
    speak(){
        console.log(
            `My name is ${this.fname}, 
            I am ${humanYears(this.age)}, 
            and I am a ${this.breed}`)
    }
    humanYears(){
        return this.age * 7; 
    }
}

```
